PL/INV/1136/17,4 Mount Street Woolton LIVERPOOL L25 6HL,"As detailed in this application, the original plan had been to replace a crumbling chimney stack - which presented a safety risk - using the correct materials of reclaimed brick, and with the entire working area for the job being 9 square metres. However, having removed the old (and note: not original, but poorly assembled) stack, the roofers established that it was not possible to build a replacement stack (the approximate measurements of which are listed below*), because there was not the sufficient underlying support for such a structure. Previous owners of the property had removed the chimney breast from ground level upwards; what's more, there was not enough basic support at loft level either. For this reason, the roofers decided to cover the relevant area of the roof with slate, in keeping with the rest of the roof. Therefore, I am submitting a planning application to retain the roof line without the chimney, as an alternative to approved planning application 16H/2214. Among the various supporting documents for this application are: a letter of explanation from Chestnut Roofers Ltd; my correspondence with planning enforcement officer Helen Brennan; and a short film showing the roof as it is now as well as the interior of 4 Mount Street (to make clear there is no chimney breast). The film footage shows the ceiling above which the chimney stack was positioned (the stains and cracks caused by the persistent leaking should be visible) as well as the wall of the same bedroom and that of the living room directly below - the shape of which should attest to the fact there is no chimney breast. In the film, my house is the one to the right, with two upstairs windows (which are slightly ajar); the chimney stack covered an area to the left of the left-sided upstairs window. The exact position, should this be required, is clarified by the accompanying architect's drawing. *Height of chimney stack: 36 inches Length across of chimney stack: 40 inches Breadth or sideways width of chimney stack: 31 inches",On-line,--,,Mr Patrick Hart ,Full Planning Permission
